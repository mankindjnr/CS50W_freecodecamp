api - application programming interface
they take requests from a user and send them to a service provider and are also responsible
    for taking the response from the service provider back to the user.

THE FOLLOWING ARE THE STEPS FOLLWOED IN THE WORKING OF api
    the client initiates the requests via the API url
    the api makes a call to the server after receiving the requests
    then the server sends the response back to the api with the information
    Finally the API transfers the data to the client

API's include authrization credentials and an API gateway to limit access so as to minimize
    security threats.

    For additional security layers to the data, HTTP headers, query string parameters or
    cookies are used.

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN API AND A WEB application

an api is an interface that allows the communication of two programs
 while a web application is anetwork based resource responsible for compliting a single task
 also all web services are API's but not all API's are web services.

there are alot of API'S BUT WILL DISCUSS REST API's FOR NOW

REST APIs
they define a set of functions GET, POST, PUT, DELETE that clients use to access   server  data

    get - retrieves a record
    put - updates a record
    post - creates a record
    delete - deletes a record

they are stateless, meaning that servers do not save clients data between requests.
All requests done vis REST API  use only HTTP request.

WORKING:
        a request is sent from the a client to a server in the form of a URL as either a
        a http get, post, put, delete request.
        A response comes back from the server in the form of a resource and can be anything
             from a html, xml, image or THE MOST POPULAR FORMAT being used in the web services
             JSON.


REQUEST AND RESPONSE examples

REQUEST - requests for all students in the geeks for geeks api
        GET:/api/students

        POST:/api/students - creating and inserting data
            {"name":"raj"}

        PUT:/api/students/1 - requesting to update data id = 1
            {"name":"Raj"}

        DELETE:/api/students/1 - request for deleting data of id = 1
